				Board Games!
			</h3>
			I myself cannot define board games. Board games might be RPG's or a digital hybrids. There are PNP (print & play) games that do not require any form of transactions.
			But again, please observe quarantine rules.

				Role-playing Forums
			</h3>
			RPG forums are online communities readily available to ease irritability. Brikwars, Wesworld, Shipbucket and some fanfiction websites are scattered across the World Wide Web.
