				Discipline in a Global Outbreak
			</h3>
			We are all heavy about some certain liberties which we are not able to practice this outbreak. 
			Some are tiresome; boredom takes a toll on you, friends and family. 
			We have to admit it, though, that we fail to follow the law. I cannot blame you. <br> <br>
			What if I tell you that we can follow the rules and still have some fun? 
			Would not that be astonishment for you? Here, I will show some activities 
			children & teenagers alike can do amidst the pandemic. <br> <br>
			Rules are essential to most aspects in life. We occasionally restrict ourselves not for a closed 
			mindset, but for a bright tomorrow. Rules are sometimes disadvantageous. They play a role for the 
			safety of our beloved. <br> <br>
			Now, let us be mindful of our actions. Let us test what we can do. <br> <br>

				Video Calls with Friends
			</h4>
			For now, the standard form of communication these days are limited to digital or non-contact meetings. Usually, we can find spare time to discuss topics with friends. Thus, a routine of two meetings a week will do. <br>

				Make Essays, Research Papers & Journals
			</h4>
			Here is an example of a report from literatures and sources concerning the advancements in warship design during the Second World War. <br> <br>
			The aftermath of the Great War exhausted the many economies of the European Powers, USA and Japan. It already saw the fall of the Triple Alliance and the degrading Triple Entente. Britain fell to its knees: It needed to compensate for its losses, and, at the same time, its colonies defined the bulk of its empire. <br> <br>
			How, in some sense, will the severed Great Britain handle its interests? The British Empire relied on its Royal Navy to strengthen might, resources and the flow of pride. Without the maritime security, Britain had no assurance of its survival. It not only threatened existence, but it also posed an attack to history as we know it. <br> <br>
			Aircraft Carrier design started during the First World War. The sole product, HMS Furious, inspired the other allied nations to experiment the trend. Not much attention was given during that time. <br> <br>
			The interwar years introduced a new possible competition with a new transformed Germany. <br>
			National Socialist Germany scanned the options to construct a better, modernized Reichsmarine. The choices were scarce enough for the new fascist-led state to design Panzerschiffs otherwise known as pocket battleships. <br> <br>
			The first batch involved the Deutschland Class. <br> <br>
			
			"The 28cm gun was chosen because gun calibre was also restricted by the Versailles treaty." <br>
			(Angus Konstam, 2020) From the book British Battleship vs German Battleship 1941-43 <br> <br>
			"However, this new ship was purpose-built to roam much farther than Germany’s territorial limits. Unusually for the time, she was powered by eight diesel engines, driving a pair of propeller shafts and generating over 53,000 shaft horsepower (shp). These gave the ship a top speed of 26 knots, and a range of up to 18,650 nautical miles at 15 knots." <br>
			(Angus Konstam, 2021) From the book Big Guns in the Atlantic Germany's Battleships and Cruiser raid the convoys 1939-41<br> <br>
			While the Germans had the Deutschland-Class Panzerschiffs, another set of cruisers were built to be known as the Admiral Hipper Class. They were planned to carry 20.3cm (8in.) guns. <br> <br>
	
			The British were not oblivious of the presence and updated the inventory with 5 36,727-ton King George V-Class Battleships. But even without the new class, the Royal Navy was already a behemoth: It was comprised of the N3, Queen Elizabeth and the obsolete Royal Sovereign Classes along with a constructed set of battlecruisers. <br> <br>
			The HMS Eagle, HMS Argus, HMS Furious and an additional construction of the Courageous Class further propelled various experiments such strength decks and armoured flight decks. <br> <br>

			The following innovations were made during the development of HMS Ark Royal. <br> <br>
	
			"The spacious flight deck – 800ft long and 94ft wide – was fitted with three small lifts, all set slightly off the centreline to avoid compromising the strength of the hull. <br> <br>

			Two hydraulic steam-powered catapults were fitted in the bow, greatly increasing the ability to launch aircraft quickly and effectively. <br> <br>

			Other innovations aimed at improving air operations included the fitting of cross-deck arrester gear towards the rear of the flight deck, landing lights to assist recovery at night or in poor daytime visibility, and a radio homing beacon mounted on the mast to guide aircraft home." <br>
			(Angus Konstam, 2010) From the book British Aircraft Carriers 1939–45 <br> <br>
			A 3-inch armour flight deck on the Illustrious-Class Fleet Carriers was another step to naval aviation. <br> <br>
	
			"Another useful wartime innovation was the development of an aircraft deck park system utilising outriggers that extended from the flight deck designed to hold the tailwheels of aircraft. This meant additional aircraft could be parked on deck without interfering with flying operations. Consequently the four carriers’ capacity increased from 36 to 52 aircraft apiece as the war progressed." <br>
			(Angus Konstam, 2010) From the book British Aircraft Carriers 1939–45 <br> <br>

				Experiment with Math
			</h4>
			Mathematics is a broad subject, from postulates to theorems, from one-dimensional tensors to complex realities and from a unit to matrices.
			We are to deal with third-year topics. Experimenting with applications can be fun. For example, the cartesian plane, simple trigonometric 
			knowledge and use of constant pi can aid us in complex geometric transformations such as non-quadrantal rotations. All said, we can work 
			on an application. <br> <br>
			Do you want other examples? The use of physical laws such as kinematics is not limited to projectiles. The Newtonian Laws of Gravitation have 
			a very extensive application field. It does not matter how complex or easy the computation is yielded. We just need to do it for our minds to 
			be well-fed and exercised. <br> <br>
