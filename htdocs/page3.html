			<h4>
				Simulation Guidelines 
			</h4>
			My friend and I were keen to develop a math game for study and practice. Basic kinematics, trigonometry and intermediate algebra are incorporated in the mechanics.
			It is similar to General Quarters 3rd Edition in some aspects such as movement and simultaneous execution. <br> <br>
			However, there are some optional rules to counter the conflict in elliptical calculations; simple arithmetic perimeter formulas for ellipses and other conic sections 
			are still debated according to accuracy. (Revised January 2022) <br> <br>
			Note that the game only requires pencil, protractor, ruler and graphing paper. <br> <br>
			We start with drawing tick marks for WWII-era warships. We either use a protractor, ruler or algebraic functions to move the ships. Some geometric transformations on 
			the tick marks are executed. <br> <br>
			There is also a ruleset that I made that does not use complex calculations. It is a mix-up of Fire on the Waters by Leonard Heinz, General Quarters and Seekrieg. Also note: 
			The house rules that I made are free. <br> <br>
			If you are interested in this naval simulation/math game, do not bother to contact me. <br> <br>
